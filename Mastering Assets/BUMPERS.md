# AudioVault Bumper Guidelines

We use two bumpers to help identify our work as an AudioVault Original:

**Head Bumper**  
Narration: *"An AudioVault Original"*  
â†’ Goes at the start of the file.  
â†’ Duration (no silence): **00:00:01.37**  
â†’ When mastered, **1 second of silence is added before** and **~0.64 seconds after**, making the final duration exactly **3 seconds**.

**Tail Bumper**  
Narration: *"This track is an AudioVault Original. It can be downloaded for free from audiovault.net."*  
â†’ Goes at the end of the file.  
â†’ Duration (no silence): **00:00:06.14**  
â†’ When mastered, **1 second of silence is added both before and after** the bumper.

## Want to contribute your own bumper read?

You're welcome to record your own versions! Here's what we ask:

- Submit **raw, unprocessed mono WAV** files.
- Must be recorded at **48 kHz**, **24-bit**.
- **Do not** add or pad with silence â€” weâ€™ll handle that during mastering.
- Recordings must **match the exact VO script** above to maintain AudioVaultâ€™s brand identity.
- You can record one or both bumpers â€” whatever youâ€™re comfortable with.
